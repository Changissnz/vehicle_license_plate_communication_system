# Vehicle License Plate Communication System

The idea behind this project is to find a suitable acronym for a message that you want to communicate. For example, "Hell's Vengeance Underground" would be "HVU"
and "Evil" would be "666".

Locate the intended destination for the message "HVU666". Then find a vehicle with the license plate "HVU666". Order a driver to drive that vehicle to the
intended destination.

That is the essence of `Vehicle License Plate Communication System`.
